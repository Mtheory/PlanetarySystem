This is a simple web-app created using Spring3 and Hibernate. This is just a simple showcase to ilustrate some of the Spring MVC features.

Project uses maven-jetty-plugin that allows running this app from the dedicated Jetty container. http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Maven+Jetty+Plugin
This means that you don't need any servers installed. Jetty will run from within this app.

It uses HSQLDB. This is an in-memory database that starts up when the app starts and dies when the app stops. http://hsqldb.org/
HSQLDB will create its schema based on hibernate mapping configuration.
This means that you don't need any DB installed.



When you download the project you can run it from maven using: 

mvn jetty:run

It starts on localhost:8090/planets/

To stop it use:

mvn jetty:stop
